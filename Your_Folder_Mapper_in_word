🧠 What problem does this code solve?
Imagine you have a giant digital cabinet (a folder) full of other folders and files — kind of like a filing cabinet full of drawers, each with papers and more folders inside.
📂 Problem:
 It’s hard to see everything inside — all the folders, subfolders, and files — especially if it’s really big. You’d have to open each folder one by one to figure out what’s inside.
✅ What this code does:
 This code is like a robot helper that walks through the entire cabinet and writes down everything it sees — folders, files, what’s inside each one — and makes a nice, clean list in a Word document.
📝 At the end, you get a document (like a report) that shows all the folders and files in a bullet-point list, showing what’s inside what. You don’t have to explore it yourself — the robot did it for you!
💡 Why it's useful:

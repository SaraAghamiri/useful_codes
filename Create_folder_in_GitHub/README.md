To make a folder in GitHub, you can't create an empty folder directly through the web interface because Git doesn't track empty folders. But you can create a folder by adding at least one file inside it. Here's how:

✅ Method 1: Create a folder via GitHub website
Go to your GitHub repository.

Click the "Add file" button, then select "Create new file".

In the filename field, type your folder name followed by a slash (/) and then a filename.

Example: myfolder/README.md

Add content to the file (or leave it blank if it’s a placeholder).

Scroll down and click "Commit new file".

GitHub will automatically create the folder (myfolder) and put the file inside it.
